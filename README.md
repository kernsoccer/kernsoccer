# kernsoccer
simple haxball clone without network but controller support.

## Todo
- update sprint (reduce energy regeneration while running. boost energy regen while standing)
- add state system (implement game states as objects nested in game, each with its own update method)
- make game responsive (keep dimensions in engine but adjust for screensize in htmlRenderer)
- update themes (remove from hud.js and apply instantly when selecting a theme in options)
- refactor emotes ()
- add maps
